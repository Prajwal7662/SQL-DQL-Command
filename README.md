Data Query Language (DQL) in SQL
📌 Overview

Data Query Language (DQL) is a subset of SQL that deals with retrieving and querying information from a database. It is primarily used to extract meaningful insights from stored data without altering the database structure or its contents. DQL is essential for data analysis, reporting, and decision-making in database-driven applications.

🛠️ Main Command

The only command under DQL is SELECT. This command allows users to fetch data from one or more tables. It can be used in combination with various clauses to filter, sort, group, and aggregate data, thereby providing flexible and powerful querying capabilities.

📊 Clauses Used with SELECT

WHERE – Filters records based on conditions.

ORDER BY – Sorts the retrieved data in ascending or descending order.

GROUP BY – Groups rows based on one or more columns for aggregation.

HAVING – Applies conditions on grouped data.

✅ Key Points

DQL focuses only on querying data and does not modify it.

It plays a crucial role in data retrieval, reporting, and analysis.

SELECT, along with its supporting clauses, makes DQL the most frequently used component of SQL.
